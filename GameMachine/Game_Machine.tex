\section{Introduction}
This Game Machine is a plugin for unreal engine 4.10 and above.
We have designed this plugin for designing mission.
\section{General description}
\section{Specific requirements}
\section{Overview}
\section{How to use}
	  \subsection{overview}
	  In game machine there are two type of graphs mission graph and dialogue graph which will going to give help mission designers to design missions easy and more afficent way.   
	  \subsection{Mission Graph}
	  Mission Graph is the place where we are going to define the flow of our mission and design objectives.
	  Here in mission graph there are four node's Mission-Root-Node, Objective-Node,Branched-Objective-Node,Multi-Objective-Node

	  \begin{center}
	  \textit{MISSION ROOT NODE}\\
	  --------------------------------------
	  \end{center}
	  This is the entry node from where our mission will be initialized.
	  \begin{center}
	  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{ObjectiveNode.png}
	  \end{center}
	  \begin{center}
	  \textit{OBJECTIVE NODE}\\
	  \----------------------------------
	  \end{center}
	  This is the node where we design our objective.
	   \begin{center}
	  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{MultiObjectiveNode.png}
	  \end{center}
	  \begin{center}
	  \textit{MULTI OBJECTIVE NODE}\\
	  \----------------------------------
	  \end{center}
	  This node same as an objective node but in this node we can design an objective which can have multiple objective.hsajdja asjdsa sajh sad hjsa hjksad ajhd as sh as sa h

	  \textit{BRANCHED OBJECTIVE NODE}\\
	  \---------------------------------------------- 
	  \end{center}
	  	  Branched Objective Node is the similar to the Multi Objective Node With slight difference.\\
	  \subsubsection{MISSION ROOT NODE}
	  As we know Mission root node is the initialization node which initialize our mission graph, this node have few properties.\\
	  \begin{center}
	 	 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
			Properties Name(Section) & Properties Description\\					\hline\hline
			Mission Type(Root Node) & Main Mission : for main 					missions\\& Side Mission : for side missions\\\hline

		\end{tabular}
	  \end{center}
	\pagebreak
	  \subsubsection{OBJECTIVE NODE}
	  this is the node where we describe our missions objective.\\

	  \subsection{Dialogue Graph}
	  Now in Dialogue graph we are going to design our dialogue's as per the mission graph.
